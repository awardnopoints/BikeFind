    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on building and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The problem and data come from a mobile phone company concerned with reducing customer churn. Customer churn happens when a customer switches mobile operator. The company wants to use the data collected about their customers to build a data analytics solution for customer churn prediction.\n",
    "Our goal is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature 'Churn'. We use the same dataset from Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models).\n",
    " \n",
    "There are 4 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 30% shown as [30].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [30] **Data Understanding:** Exploring relationships between feature pairs and selecting promising features.\n",
    "    - (1.1) Randomly shuffle the rows of your dataset and split the dataset into two datasets: 70% training and 30% test. Keep the test set aside. \n",
    "    - (1.2) On the training set:\n",
    "        - Plot the correlations between all the continuous features. Discuss what you see in these plots.\n",
    "        - For each continuous feature, plot its interaction with the target feature (a plot for each pair of continuous feature and target feature). Discuss what you observe from these plots, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of continuous features you find promising. Justify your choices.\n",
    "        - For each categorical feature, plot the pairwise interaction with the target feature. Discuss what knowledge you gain from these plots, e.g., which categorical features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of categorical features you find promising. Justify your choices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(2). [25] **Predictive Modeling:** Linear Regression.  \n",
    "    - (2.1) On the training set, train a linear regression model to predict the target feature Churn, using only the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above. \n",
    "    - (2.2) Print the coefficients learned by the model and discuss their role in the model (e.g., interpret the model).    \n",
    "    - (2.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 100 training examples. Threshold the predicted target feature value given by the linear regression model at 0.5, to get the predicted class for each example. Print the predicted class for the first 100 examples. Print the classification evaluation measures computed on the training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained when using the training (70%) dataset for evaluation. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset).\n",
    "    \n",
    "(3). [25] **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic Regression.  \n",
    "    - (3.1) On the training set, train a logistic regression model to predict the target feature Churn, using the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above.   \n",
    "    - (3.2) Print the coefficients learned by the model and discuss their role in the model (e.g., interpret the model).    \n",
    "    - (3.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 100 training examples. Print the predicted class for the first 100 examples. Print the classification evaluation measures computed on the training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (3.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained when using the training (70%) dataset for evaluation. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset).\n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [20] **Improving Predictive Models.**\n",
    "    - (4.1) Which model of the ones trained above performs better at predicting Churn? Is it more accurate than a simple (but useless) model that always predicts the majority class (i.e., if Churn=0 is the majority class in your dataset, the simple model always predicts 0 for the target feature)? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (4.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining models, or using other knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice, by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far."

    "The charts don't show us much, but from the tables we can see that Credit Rating (numerical), Handset Age, and Rejected Retention Calls exhibit strong positive correlations with Churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "**creditRatingNum** implies that those in better financial positions are more free to change phone company if their current contract does not suit them. Those who have had their handset for longer may be interested in switching up their plan, as indicated by **handsetAge**. **numRetentionOffersRejected** also has visible correlations with churn, indicating that those who are called about retention offers and turn them down are likely to churn afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that numRetentionOffersRejected and creditRatingNum are new features that were added to the dataframe in **Fixing-Homework-1**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "On the negative side of things, **avgMins** correlates with not churning. This implies that those who use their phones regularly are less likely to churn. **avgrecurringCharge** has a similar strength. This could be related to avgMins, but with a correlation of just over *0.55* that isn't strong enough for me to discount the feature entirely. **avgOutCalls** also correlates strongly with the features, but given its strong *0.74* correlation with avgMins, it's probably best to leave it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they did not exhibit strong correlation with churn, I would haved considered the **avgBill** feature significant in that an increased bill might convince someone to churn, especially paired with avgMins. Similarly, **lifetime** is an important context for features like handsetAge. However, neither of these present any strong correlation with the target feature, so to avoid unnecessary noise I will exclude them."

    "The graphed results highlight some interesting aspects of these features. It's notable that the addition of handsetAge as the second feature slightly increases the Precision but sends the Recall value plummeting. This implies that the pair of creditRatingNum and handsetAge, while allowing for slightly more precise guessing, actually greatly decreases the number of correctly predicted churn cases. It's also notable that, while most values gradually reduce with the addition of every feature after avgBills as the third, Accuracy and Precision see slight boosts with the addition of the numRetentionOffersRejected feature as the sixth. This may imply that, while catching less of the churn cases ultimately, numRetentionOffersRejected gives a degree of extra precision.\n",

    "This is mostly irrelevant, however, as the graph reveals the third cross-validated model, including creditRatingNum, handsetAge, and avgMins, to be the strongest model for all metrics. This combination of features reduces the random noise of the later features while overcoming the drastic drop in recall from handsetAge. This new model should provide the best results whether accuracy, recall, or precision is the aim."

    "Based on my tests so far, I have found that a Logistic Regression model based around the features **creditRatingNum**, **handsetAge**, and **avgMins** turns in the best results for the dataset provided. Upon a full cross-validated evaluation of this model, alongside alternatives that used more or less features, these three features came out on top. It works with 57% accuracy, and is weighted slightly more in favour of Recall than Precision, meaning that it is better at returning as many True Positives as possible, than it is at avoiding False Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "creditRatingNum was the feature with the strongest coefficient attached to it. This was a feature that I created myself, converting the values in the creditRating table to numerics, with A as the highest and G as the lowest. The rate of conversion was arbitrary, and it could possibly be adjusted to better reflect the significance between these grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature that I created was **numRetentionOffersRejected**, based on the difference between the numRetentionCalls and numRetentionOffersAccepted features. The coefficient of this feature was extremely strong, as rejecting a retention offer naturally correlates with plans to change providers. However, it ultimately had to be left out as it caused more noise being left in, due to the fact that the vast majority of customers received no retention calls, and an even smaller subset of those customers rejected them. A more complex model, perhaps a tree-based one, could open by checking this feature, assuming churn if its value was greater than 0. This model could then feed all 0 results into the logistic regression model using the features above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model fared only slightly better than its Linear counterpart. Given that the target value was a boolean, a greater difference was to be expected. It's possible that with a different set of features or a different data segment the difference between these two would have been more prominent."
